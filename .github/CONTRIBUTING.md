# Contributing Guidelines

We will happily accept PRs to improve the tooling for `express-hotwire`. This library should follow the work being done in the `@hotwire/turbo` and `turbo-rails` libraries, but I'm also open to any innovative ways to make hotwire work well with the Node.js ecosystem.

Please use `git cz` for your commit messages when contributing. This allows us to generate the CHANGELOG file automatically at release time.

Make sure you follow the linting rules provided in the repo. You can use the `yarn fix`/`npm run fix` command to fix any issues with linting before pushing up your changes. The build will fail if the changes do not follow the required formatting.
