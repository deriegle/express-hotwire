### âš  BREAKING CHANGES

- **src/index.ts:** We are now exporting a function that builds the middleware. This matches what the
  documentation has said. It also matches what other express middleware does. You should import the
  middleware using `app.use(expressHotwire());`

### Features

- **hotwire-middleware:** allow content to be passed as an option to res.turboStream.\* methods ([a82451b](https://github.com/deriegle/express-hotwire/commit/a82451b9a90aab56f73ca89dcd9ccc9e4acf0cb2))
